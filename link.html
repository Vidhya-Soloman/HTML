<h3 id="sec1">CLIENT/SERVER</h3>
<img src="C:\Users\Vidhiya\OneDrive\Desktop\html\img.jpeg" alt="no image">
<p>A client is any computer hardware or software device that requests access to a service provided by a server. Clients are typically seen as the requesting program or user in a client-server architecture.
<br><br>
A web server is a computer that runs websites. It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they are requisitioned. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

<h3 id="sec2">Components Of Web Application</h3>
<p>All web-based database applications have three primary components: A web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server. Web-based database applications rely on a database server, which provides the data for the application.

<h3>Types Of Web Content</h3>
<ol>
<li>Articles</li>

This type of web content develops an idea and incorporates interviews, quotes, and data to support the article’s hypothesis. Articles are usually long-form content, between 1,000 and 3,000 words.
<li>Blog posts</li>

Blog posts typically range between 500 and 750 words, focusing on a variety of topics. Some of these topics can include news in the industry, bios of industry leaders, reviews of new products, and more.
<li>Surveys</li>

Adding surveys to your content arsenal can gauge your readers’ interest and to increase reader engagement with your brand. Surveys are also fun for the reader and is one of the more interactive content types.
<li>Quizzes</li>

Quizzes are another way to engage your reader, by having a question on one page and the answer on the next, which adds extra potential for ad revenue and click-throughs.
<li>Photos</li>

Images help make your content more visually appealing, and contributes to the overall user experience. Additionally, optimizing your photos with alt-text and captions to your images can even help with your rankings on Google Images.
<li>Videos<li>

Using videos is a great way to diversify your content and add visual interest to your pages. These can be videos you take yourself or videos from sources like YouTube or Vimeo. (Just make sure to give credit where credit is due.)
<li>Case studies</li>

Case studies outline how a particular individual or company used a product or service. Seeing a real person use your product can help potential buyers see themselves using it and, thus, encouragement to purchase from you.
<li>Website content</li>

Website content encompasses many content types. This can include website pages detailing your individual services, products, people, locations, etc.
<li>Guest blogs or posts</li>

Find guest writers from notable people in your industry, writers of other blogs or websites that focus on your topic, or on social media pages or groups related to your topic. Adding a few posts by guest writers adds a new voice to your pages and helps to bring in new readers to your website.
<li>Interviews</li>

First person interviews with people actively involved in your topic is a way to share different points of view with your readers and expand their knowledge of your topic. You can ask readers to submit questions in advance to increase your user engagement.

<h3>HTTP request</h3>
<p>A correctly composed HTTP request contains the following elements: A request line. A series of HTTP headers, or header fields. A message body, if needed.
</p>
<h3>Generation Of Dynamic Webpages</h3>
<p>Dynamic websites use various client-side and server-side languages to build web pages on the back end. Examples include JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the client-side and Python, Ruby, and PHP for the server-side. The amount of information pulled to generate the page varies, and the process can be complex.
